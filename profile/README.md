# Dual-Frame Research Group

The Dual-Frame Research Group develops **Sigma-Order theory (Σ-Order, ΣO)** — a
parameter-light, geometry-first framework for understanding quantization,
coherence limits, and correlation structure across quantum, atomic, and
macroscopic systems.

> **Naming note:** This research program historically used the name **Dual-Frame Theory (DFT)**.
> Because “DFT” is widely associated with Density Functional Theory, the framework is now indexed
> under **Sigma-Order (Σ-Order, ΣO)** terminology.  
>  
> The term **Dual-Frame** remains valid when referring specifically to the dual projection
> structure (Temporal / Spatial frames). Existing repositories and publications retain their
> original naming for archival and citation stability. The underlying geometric and structural
> program remains continuous.

Σ-Order theory proposes that many discrete and correlation-driven physical phenomena arise
from **topological and admissibility constraints on motion** when a universal scalar progression
is projected into complementary Temporal (T) and Spatial (S) frames. The framework emphasizes
explicit falsifiability, frozen-parameter validation, and constraint-first structural analysis.

## Conceptual Orientation

### Motion-First, Geometry-Based View

Σ-Order theory builds on a motion-first perspective in which space and time are reciprocally
related projections of scalar progression.

Most conventional theoretical models preserve spatial structure explicitly while collapsing
reciprocal temporal structure into reduced state-based representations. Σ-Order theory identifies
the structural boundaries where such reductions remain faithful — and where they fail.

This structural program includes a representational reconstruction of quantum kinematics from
distinguishability relations on motion histories, establishing the algebraic conditions under
which Hilbert-space structure emerges canonically:

### Structural Adequacy and Σ-Order Hierarchy

Σ-Order theory identifies layered structural regimes governing representational adequacy.

These regimes form the **Sigma-Order hierarchy (Σ₁, Σ₂, Σ₃, …)**, which classifies admissibility
according to closure stability and projection consistency.

One such regime, **Σ₂ (second-order constraint geometry)**, marks the boundary where discarded
temporal structure becomes necessary for faithful representation across:

- continuation (cross-window persistence)
- intervention (protocol changes)
- re-projection (alternate observables)

Σ₂ does not introduce new dynamics; it identifies structural adequacy limits of reduced models.

### Where Σ-Order Theory Reproduces vs. Competes

**Σ-Order reproduces standard QM and GR** in validated regimes:

- coherence envelopes
- uncertainty relations
- weak-field gravity
- stationary spectral relationships

**Σ-Order competes at admissibility boundaries**, predicting structural refusal where standard
models rely on effective parameters or inference assumptions.
