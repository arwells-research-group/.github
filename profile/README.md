# Dual-Frame Research Group

The Dual-Frame Research Group develops **Dual-Frame Theory (DFT)** — a
parameter-light, geometry-first framework focused on explaining quantization,
coherence limits, and correlation structure across quantum, atomic, and macroscopic
systems, with explicit falsifiability.

## Pinned highlights
- **dft-core-theory** — canonical foundations, structure, and verification standards
- **gor-kernel-model** — coherence aperture ($L \approx 3.8\,a_0$) verification and shell-structure gates
- **gor-caf** — NIST first ionization energies and $+3/-4$ GOR residual structure
- **satz-lifetime-diagnostics** — β-decay / EC lifetime scaling with frozen coefficients and residual isolation
- **dft-astro-nonlocal-kinematics** — SPARC rotation-curve pipeline with fixed nonlocal kernels and holdout gates
- **hom-phase-diffusion** — Hong–Ou–Mandel bunching from deterministic phase diffusion
- **dual-frame-information-theory** — formal information-theoretic constraints and compression complementarity

## Research principles
- **Geometry-first explanations**, minimal free parameters
- **Verification-first practice**: public data, fixed gates, deterministic holdouts
- **Reproducibility**: scripts and pipelines intended to be rerun end-to-end
- **Archival releases**: stable citations anchored to tagged versions (Zenodo DOI)

## Scope
This organization contains theory notes, reference implementations, and validation
pipelines across:
- atomic/structural physics
- nuclear decay and lifetime diagnostics
- quantum optics and coherence
- astrophysical kinematics
- vacuum geometry and Casimir/MEMS modeling

Formal information-theoretic work (e.g., compression and representation trade-offs) is included where it provides cross-domain constraints or bridges to machine learning and cognitive systems.

> Start with **dft-core-theory**. The pinned repositories are the primary entry points.

These repositories emphasize constraint discovery and falsifiable structure, not comprehensive simulation toolkits.
