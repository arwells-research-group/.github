# Dual-Frame Research Group

The Dual-Frame Research Group develops **Dual-Frame Theory (DFT)** — a
parameter-light, geometry-first framework for understanding quantization,
coherence limits, and correlation structure across quantum, atomic, and
macroscopic systems.

DFT proposes that many discrete and correlation-driven physical phenomena arise
from **topological constraints on motion** when a universal scalar progression is
projected into complementary Temporal (T) and Spatial (S) frames. The framework
emphasizes explicit falsifiability and limits-first validation.

## Conceptual Orientation

### Motion-First, Geometry-Based View

DFT builds on a motion-first perspective in which space and time are reciprocally
related projections of scalar progression. In practice, most theoretical models
preserve spatial structure explicitly while collapsing reciprocal temporal
structure into reduced, state-based descriptions.

### Structural Adequacy and Σ₂

DFT examines the consequences of this projection asymmetry and identifies
**structural conditions under which such reductions cease to remain sufficient**.

One such condition is denoted **Σ₂** (second-order constraint geometry), which
marks the boundary where discarded temporal structure becomes necessary for
faithful representation across:
- Continuation (cross-window persistence)
- Intervention (protocol changes)
- Re-projection (alternate observables)

**Σ₂ does not introduce new dynamics or ontology**; it identifies boundaries of
structural adequacy within reduced models and provides refusal conditions when
those boundaries are exceeded.

### Where DFT Reproduces vs. Competes

**DFT reproduces** standard quantum mechanics and general relativity in their
validated, maximally-constrained regimes (coherence envelopes, uncertainty
relations, weak-field gravity).

**DFT competes** by predicting explicit geometric admissibility boundaries and
cross-domain structural invariants that standard formalisms treat as model
choice, effective parameters, or inference artifacts.

## Research Principles

**Geometry-first explanations** with minimal free parameters  
- Topological constraints on motion generate observed structure
- No hidden variables or new dynamical postulates at the foundational level

**Limits-first practice**  
- Identify where reductions remain faithful and where they fail
- Explicit admissibility conditions and refusal logic (BOUNDARY verdicts)

**Verification-first methodology**  
- Public datasets (NIST, ENSDF, SPARC, OpenNeuro, etc.)
- Frozen parameters fixed prior to evaluation
- Deterministic validation with explicit falsification gates

**Reproducibility**  
- End-to-end scripts and rerunnable pipelines
- Deterministic seeds and documented parameter choices

**Archival releases**  
- Stable citations anchored to tagged versions (Zenodo DOI)
- Major revisions tracked as versioned theoretical events

## Scope and Regimes

This organization contains theory notes, reference implementations, and
validation pipelines spanning multiple **physical regimes**:

- Atomic and structural physics (ionization energies, shell structure)
- Nuclear decay and lifetime diagnostics (β-decay, phase-space scaling)
- Quantum optics and coherence phenomena (interference, correlations, antibunching)
- Astrophysical kinematics (rotation curves, nonlocal geometry)
- Vacuum geometry and Casimir/MEMS modeling
- Bell-type correlations and quantum foundations
- Radiation phenomenology (phase evolution, decoherence)

Formal information-theoretic work (compression and representation trade-offs)
is included where it clarifies structural limits or provides cross-regime
constraints, including connections to machine learning, reinforcement learning,
and organizational dynamics.

**These repositories emphasize constraint discovery and falsifiable structure**,
not comprehensive simulation toolkits or domain-specific modeling frameworks.
