# Dual-Frame Research Group

The Dual-Frame Research Group develops **Dual-Frame Theory (DFT)** — a
parameter-light, geometry-first framework that attempts to address how
conventional theoretical physics models can be limited by reductions that
discard intrinsic structure and dynamics, thereby hindering a deeper
understanding of physical phenomena across regimes.

DFT focuses on explaining quantization, coherence limits, and correlation
structure across quantum, atomic, and macroscopic systems, with explicit
falsifiability and limits-first validation.

## Conceptual orientation

DFT builds on a motion-first, geometry-based view of physical structure in which
space and time are reciprocally related. In practice, most theoretical models
preserve spatial structure explicitly while collapsing reciprocal temporal
structure into reduced, state-based descriptions.

DFT examines the consequences of this asymmetry and identifies **structural
conditions under which such reductions cease to remain sufficient**. One such
condition is denoted **Σ₂**, which marks the point at which discarded structure
becomes necessary for understanding across regimes. Σ₂ does not introduce new
dynamics or ontology; it identifies a boundary of structural adequacy within
reduced models.

## Representative Research Threads

The following repositories illustrate how DFT is applied to identify
structural constraints, regime transitions, and verification boundaries
in different physical contexts:

- **dft-core-theory** — canonical foundations, structural framework, and verification standards
- **gor-kernel-model** — coherence aperture verification and shell-structure gating
- **gor-caf** — ionization-energy residual structure under fixed reduction constraints
- **satz-lifetime-diagnostics** — lifetime scaling and reduction adequacy tests in nuclear decay
- **dft-astro-nonlocal-kinematics** — nonlocal kernel constraints in galactic rotation regimes
- **hom-phase-diffusion** — coherence breakdown and recovery across optical regimes
- **dual-frame-information-theory** — representation limits and compression complementarity

## Research principles

- **Geometry-first explanations** with minimal free parameters
- **Limits-first practice**: identifying where reductions remain faithful and where they fail
- **Verification-first methodology**: public data, fixed gates, deterministic holdouts
- **Reproducibility**: end-to-end scripts and rerunnable pipelines
- **Archival releases**: stable citations anchored to tagged versions (Zenodo DOI)

---

## Scope

This organization contains theory notes, reference implementations, and
validation pipelines spanning multiple **regimes**, including:

- atomic and structural physics
- nuclear decay and lifetime diagnostics
- quantum optics and coherence phenomena
- astrophysical kinematics
- vacuum geometry and Casimir/MEMS modeling

Formal information-theoretic work (e.g., compression and representation trade-offs)
is included where it clarifies structural limits or provides cross-regime
constraints, including connections to machine learning and cognitive systems.

> The pinned repositories are the primary entry points.

These repositories emphasize constraint discovery and falsifiable structure,
not comprehensive simulation toolkits or domain-specific modeling frameworks.
